<h1> <center>BELIEFS</h1>
<p>Adventists believe that the Second Coming of Christ will happen soon. Christ's return will be "will be literal, personal, visible, and worldwide". On that day the righteous dead will be resurrected and taken with him to heaven, together with the righteous living. The unrighteous will die.</p>
